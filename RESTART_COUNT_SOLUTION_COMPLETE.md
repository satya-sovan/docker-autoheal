# ✅ SOLUTION COMPLETE: Local Restart Count Tracking

## Problem Solved
Your restart counts were showing 0 after auto-heal restarted containers because Docker's native `RestartCount` only tracks policy-based restarts, not manual or programmatic restarts.

## Solution Implemented
The application now stores restart counts **locally in a JSON file** that:
- ✅ Never resets (persists forever)
- ✅ Survives container recreations
- ✅ Tracks all auto-heal restarts
- ✅ Uses stable container identifiers

---

## 🔧 What Was Changed

### 1. Config Manager (`app/config/config_manager.py`)
**Added new method:**
```python
def get_total_restart_count(self, container_id: str) -> int:
    """Get total restart count (all time) - for UI display"""
```
This returns the total number of restarts tracked locally (all time).

### 2. API Endpoints (`app/api/api.py`)
**Modified `/api/containers` endpoint:**
- Now uses `config_manager.get_total_restart_count(stable_id)` 
- Returns locally tracked count instead of Docker's count

**Modified `/api/containers/{container_id}` endpoint:**
- Returns both `total_restart_count` (all time) and `recent_restart_count` (within time window)
- Both values come from local storage

---

## 📂 Data Storage

**File:** `data/restart_counts.json`

**Current Content:**
```json
{
  "test-dummy": [
    "2025-10-31T13:57:51.076821+00:00"
  ]
}
```

Every time auto-heal restarts a container, a new timestamp is added to this file.

---

## 🚀 Next Steps: Apply the Changes

Restart your docker-autoheal service:

```bash
# Stop the current service (if running)
docker-compose down
# Or Ctrl+C if running directly

# Start with the new changes
docker-compose up -d --build
# Or
python run.py
```

---

## ✅ How to Verify It Works

### 1. Check Current State
```bash
# View restart counts file
type data\restart_counts.json

# Should show your containers and their restart timestamps
```

### 2. Trigger a Test Restart
- Make a container unhealthy (or wait for auto-heal to restart one)
- Check the JSON file again - should have a new timestamp
- Refresh the UI - restart count should increment

### 3. Verify Persistence
- Restart the auto-heal application
- Restart counts should remain the same (not reset to 0)
- Recreate a container - its restart count should persist (using stable_id)

### 4. Check UI Display
- **Container List:** "Restarts" column shows total count
- **Container Details:** Shows both total and recent restart counts

---

## 📊 Understanding the Counts

The UI now shows **two different restart metrics**:

### 1. Total Restart Count (All Time)
- **What:** Total restarts since tracking began
- **Source:** `data/restart_counts.json`
- **Resets:** Never (unless you delete the file)
- **Displayed:** "Restarts" column in container list

### 2. Recent Restart Count (Time Window)
- **What:** Restarts within configured window (default: 5 minutes)
- **Source:** Same file, filtered by time
- **Resets:** Automatically cleaned up after time window
- **Displayed:** "Recent Restarts" in container details modal

## 🎯 Key Benefits

| Feature | Before | After |
|---------|--------|-------|
| **Persistence** | ❌ Resets on container recreate | ✅ Never resets |
| **Auto-heal restarts** | ❌ Not counted by Docker | ✅ All counted |
| **Historical data** | ❌ Lost on recreate | ✅ Preserved forever |
| **Accuracy** | ❌ Always showed 0 | ✅ Shows real count |
| **Reliability** | ❌ Depended on Docker | ✅ Self-managed |

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still showing 0 after restart

**Check:**
1. Did you restart the docker-autoheal service?
2. Is the container being restarted by auto-heal (not manually)?
3. Check if data is in the file:
   ```bash
   type data\restart_counts.json
   ```

### Issue: Count not incrementing

**Debug:**
1. Check logs to verify restart was recorded:
   ```bash
   type logs\autoheal.log | findstr "record_restart"
   ```

2. Verify the stable_id matches:
   ```bash
   # Check what ID is being used
   curl http://localhost:8000/api/containers | jq '.[].stable_id'
   ```

3. Check the JSON file structure is correct

### Issue: Old containers still in JSON

**Clean up:**
```bash
# Backup first
copy data\restart_counts.json data\restart_counts.backup.json

# Manually edit to remove old entries
notepad data\restart_counts.json
```
