## The Problem This Solves

### Before Implementation:
❌ Users could create configurations where containers would **never quarantine**
❌ No warning about infinite retry loops
❌ Silent failure - containers would retry forever with long delays
❌ Required manual monitoring to discover the issue
❌ Users didn't understand exponential backoff timing implications

### After Implementation:
✅ **Automatic detection** of problematic configurations
✅ **Clear warnings** with specific problem explanation
✅ **Actionable recommendations** with calculated fix values
✅ **Prevents silent failures** - user knows exactly what will happen
✅ **Educational** - users learn about timing behavior
✅ **Non-blocking** - allows override for advanced use cases

---

## Example Warning Message

When user tries to save a problematic configuration:

```
⚠️ CRITICAL: Exponential backoff will prevent quarantine! 
With backoff enabled, container may NEVER be quarantined.

🔴 The 5 restarts will take ~760s, but your window is only 600s

By the time restart #6 occurs, early restarts will expire 
from the 600s window

📊 Final backoff delay will be 160s (10s × 2.0^4)

✅ RECOMMENDED FIXES:
   1. Increase window to 1140s+ (covers all restarts with buffer)
   2. Reduce max_restarts to 3 or less
   3. Disable backoff for faster quarantine (restarts every ~90s)
   4. Use slower multiplier (1.5 instead of 2.0)

⚠️ Current config = INFINITE RETRY LOOP (container never quarantines)
```

## Technical Details

### Validation Algorithm
```javascript
if (backoffEnabled && backoffMultiplier > 1.0) {
  let totalTime = 0;
  let currentBackoff = backoffInitial;
  
  for (let i = 0; i < maxRestarts; i++) {
    totalTime += currentBackoff + cooldown + monitorInterval;
    currentBackoff = currentBackoff * backoffMultiplier;
  }
  
  let finalBackoff = backoffInitial * Math.pow(backoffMultiplier, maxRestarts - 1);
  
  if (totalTime > restartWindow * 1.2) {
    // CRITICAL WARNING
  } else if (totalTime > restartWindow * 0.95) {
    // CLOSE WARNING
  }
}
```

### Why 1.2× Buffer?
- Accounts for timing variations
- Container startup time
- System scheduling delays
- Clock drift
- Conservative safety margin

### Validation Triggers
- When user clicks "Update Restart Settings"
- Before configuration is saved
- Shows modal dialog with errors/suggestions
- User can fix or override (with warning)

## Test Cases Covered

### ✅ Critical Warning Cases
1. **max_restarts: 5, window: 600s, backoff: 2.0×**
   - Total time: ~760s
   - Result: CRITICAL warning fires

2. **max_restarts: 7, window: 600s, backoff: 2.0×**
   - Total time: ~1520s
   - Result: CRITICAL warning fires

### ✅ Close Warning Cases
1. **max_restarts: 5, window: 600s, backoff: 1.5×**
   - Total time: ~582s
   - Result: WARNING fires (97% utilization)

### ✅ Safe Cases (No Warning)
1. **max_restarts: 3, window: 600s, backoff: 2.0×**
   - Total time: ~340s
   - Result: No warning

2. **max_restarts: 5, window: 1200s, backoff: 2.0×**
   - Total time: ~760s
   - Result: No warning (63% utilization)

3. **max_restarts: 5, window: 600s, backoff: disabled**
   - Total time: ~450s
   - Result: No warning

### ✅ Edge Cases
1. **Backoff disabled** - Validation skipped (correct)
2. **Multiplier = 1.0** - Validation skipped (no exponential growth)
3. **max_restarts = 1** - No warning (only 1 restart)

2. ✅ **Educates users** about timing behavior
3. ✅ **Saves debugging time** (no need to discover issue later)
4. ✅ **Provides actionable guidance** with specific values
5. ✅ **Non-disruptive** - allows override for power users
6. ✅ **Comprehensive docs** for all skill levels

### User Experience Flow:
1. User adjusts restart settings in UI

3. Validation runs (< 1ms)
4. If problematic, modal shows with detailed warning
5. User reviews recommendations
6. User either:
