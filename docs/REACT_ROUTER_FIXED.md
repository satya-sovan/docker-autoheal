# ✅ FIXED - React Router 404 Error on Page Refresh

## Problem

When refreshing the page on routes like `/containers`, `/events`, or `/config`, you got:
```json
{"detail":"Not Found"}
```

## Root Cause

**Single Page Application (SPA) routing issue:**

1. React Router handles routing **client-side** (in the browser)
2. When you refresh `/containers`, the browser makes a **server request** to `/containers`
3. FastAPI only had a route for `/` (root), not for `/containers`
4. Result: **404 Not Found**

This is a common issue with SPAs deployed on traditional web servers.

## Solution Applied

✅ **Added a catch-all route** to FastAPI that serves `index.html` for all non-API routes.

### What Was Changed

**File: `api.py`**

**Added:**
```python
# Helper function to serve React index.html
def serve_react_app():
    """Helper function to serve React index.html"""
    try:
        with open("static/index.html", "r", encoding="utf-8") as f:
            return HTMLResponse(content=f.read())
    except FileNotFoundError:
        return HTMLResponse(content="...")

# Catch-all route for React Router
@app.get("/{full_path:path}", response_class=HTMLResponse)
async def serve_ui_catchall(full_path: str):
    """Serve the React UI for all non-API routes (React Router support)"""
    # Don't intercept API routes, docs, or static files
    if full_path.startswith(("api/", "docs", "redoc", "openapi.json", "assets/", "static/")):
        raise HTTPException(status_code=404, detail="Not Found")
    return serve_react_app()
```

**How it works:**
1. Any request to a non-API route (e.g., `/containers`, `/events`, `/config`)
2. Gets caught by the catch-all route `/{full_path:path}`
3. Returns `index.html` (the React app)
4. React Router loads and handles the routing client-side
5. Shows the correct page!

## Container Rebuilt

✅ Applied with: `docker-compose up --build -d`

## Verify the Fix

### Test All Routes

```powershell
# Root - should work
curl http://localhost:8080/

# Containers - should work now (was 404 before)
curl http://localhost:8080/containers

# Events - should work now
curl http://localhost:8080/events

# Config - should work now
curl http://localhost:8080/config

# API routes still work
curl http://localhost:8080/api/status
curl http://localhost:8080/api/containers

# Docs still work
curl http://localhost:8080/docs
```

All should return HTML (React app) or JSON (API endpoints).

### Test in Browser

1. Open http://localhost:8080
2. Navigate to **Containers** tab
3. **Refresh the page (F5)**
4. ✅ Should still show Containers page (no 404!)

## What Routes Are Protected

The catch-all route **excludes** these from being intercepted:
- ✅ `/api/*` - All API endpoints
- ✅ `/docs` - API documentation
- ✅ `/redoc` - Alternative API docs
- ✅ `/openapi.json` - OpenAPI spec
- ✅ `/assets/*` - Static assets (JS, CSS)
- ✅ `/static/*` - Static files

Everything else gets the React app, allowing React Router to work.

## How React Router Works Now

```
User navigates to /containers in browser
           ↓
FastAPI receives request to /containers
           ↓
Catch-all route catches it
           ↓
Returns index.html (React app)
           ↓
React app loads in browser
           ↓
React Router sees URL is /containers
           ↓
Shows ContainersPage component
           ↓
✅ User sees Containers page!
```

## Test Results

```
✅ Health endpoint OK
✅ API endpoint OK
✅ React UI accessible
✅ Metrics OK

4/4 PASSED
```

## Benefits

✅ **Page refresh works** on all routes  
✅ **Direct URL access** works (e.g., share `/containers` link)  
✅ **Browser back/forward** buttons work correctly  
✅ **Bookmarks** work for any page  
✅ **API routes unaffected** - still return JSON  

## Common SPA Deployment Pattern

This is the **standard solution** for deploying SPAs:

| Server | Pattern |
|--------|---------|
| **Nginx** | `try_files $uri /index.html;` |
| **Apache** | `RewriteRule ^ /index.html` |
| **Express.js** | `app.get('*', (req, res) => res.sendFile('index.html'))` |
| **FastAPI** | `@app.get("/{full_path:path}")` ← **What we did** |

## Before vs After

### Before (Broken)
```
http://localhost:8080/           ✅ Works
http://localhost:8080/containers ❌ 404 Not Found
http://localhost:8080/events     ❌ 404 Not Found
http://localhost:8080/config     ❌ 404 Not Found
```

### After (Fixed)
```
http://localhost:8080/           ✅ Works
http://localhost:8080/containers ✅ Works
http://localhost:8080/events     ✅ Works
http://localhost:8080/config     ✅ Works
```

## Summary

✅ **Problem**: Page refresh on `/containers` returned 404  
✅ **Cause**: FastAPI didn't have routes for React Router paths  
✅ **Solution**: Added catch-all route to serve React app  
✅ **Result**: All routes work, refresh works, direct links work  
✅ **Status**: **FIXED**  

## Try It Now

1. Open http://localhost:8080/containers
2. Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
3. ✅ Page loads correctly!

**No more 404 errors on page refresh! 🎉**
