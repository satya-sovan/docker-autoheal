# ‚úÖ UI Loading Issue - FIXED

## Problem
After implementing the auto-monitoring feature, the UI was not loading. The application was hanging at startup.

## Cause
The Docker event stream is a **blocking generator** that waits indefinitely for events. When we tried to iterate over it in the async loop, it blocked the entire event loop, preventing the UI from loading.

## Solution
Changed the event listener to use a **producer-consumer pattern**:
- **Producer Thread**: Separate daemon thread reads blocking Docker event stream
- **Thread-Safe Queue**: Passes events between thread and async loop
- **Consumer (Async)**: Main async loop processes events from queue without blocking

## Fix Applied

**File**: `monitor.py`  
**Method**: `_event_listener_loop()`

The event listener now:
1. ‚úÖ Runs Docker event stream in a separate daemon thread
2. ‚úÖ Uses `queue.Queue()` for thread-safe communication
3. ‚úÖ Processes events in async loop with timeout (non-blocking)
4. ‚úÖ Keeps UI responsive and loads immediately

## Testing the Fix

```bash
# 1. Restart the service
docker-compose down
docker-compose up --build -d

# 2. Check UI loads (should work immediately)
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# 3. Access Web UI
# Open http://localhost:8080 in browser

# 4. Test auto-monitoring still works
docker run -d --name test --label autoheal=true nginx:alpine

# 5. Check logs
docker logs docker-autoheal | grep "Auto-monitoring"
# Should see: ‚úì Auto-monitoring enabled for container 'test'

# 6. Clean up
docker rm -f test
```

## Expected Behavior

### Before Fix ‚ùå
- UI never loads
- Browser shows "waiting for localhost..."
- Logs show event stream connected but nothing else happens
- Service appears hung

### After Fix ‚úÖ
- UI loads immediately
- Web interface accessible at http://localhost:8080
- All API endpoints respond
- Event listener runs in background thread
- Auto-monitoring works correctly

## Verification

After restarting the service, you should see:

```
INFO - Monitoring engine started
INFO - Event listener started for auto-monitoring containers with autoheal=true label
DEBUG - Docker event listener thread started
INFO - Application startup complete.
INFO - Uvicorn running on http://0.0.0.0:8080
```

And the UI should load at http://localhost:8080

## Technical Details

**Pattern Used**: Producer-Consumer with Threading
- Isolates blocking I/O in separate thread
- Uses `queue.Queue` for thread-safe communication
- Async loop checks queue with timeout (non-blocking)

**Why This Works**:
- Docker event stream blocks in its own thread (doesn't affect main loop)
- Queue operations are fast and non-blocking (with timeout)
- Async loop remains responsive for HTTP requests

## Status

üéâ **Issue Resolved!**

The auto-monitoring feature is now fully functional AND the UI loads correctly.

## Quick Commands

```bash
# Rebuild and restart
docker-compose up --build -d

# Check UI
curl http://localhost:8080/health

# View logs
docker logs docker-autoheal --tail 50

# Test auto-monitoring
docker run -d --label autoheal=true nginx:alpine
```
