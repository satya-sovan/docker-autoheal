# ✅ RESTART COUNT FIX - ACTION CHECKLIST

## Problem
Restart counts showing 0 after auto-heal restarts containers.

## Solution Status: ✅ COMPLETE

All code changes have been implemented. You just need to restart the service.

---

## 📋 What Was Done

- ✅ Added `get_total_restart_count()` method to config_manager.py
- ✅ Modified `/api/containers` endpoint to use local tracking
- ✅ Modified `/api/containers/{container_id}` endpoint to use local tracking
- ✅ Verified data/restart_counts.json exists and works
- ✅ Created comprehensive documentation

---

## 🚀 NEXT STEP: Restart the Service

Choose ONE of these methods:

### Method 1: Docker Compose (Recommended)
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d --build
```

### Method 2: Docker Compose (Quick Restart)
```bash
docker-compose restart
```

### Method 3: Python (Direct)
```bash
# Press Ctrl+C to stop current process
# Then run:
python run.py
```

---

## ✅ Verify It Works

### 1. Check Current Restart Data
```bash
type data\restart_counts.json
```
**Expected:** Should see your containers with timestamps

### 2. Open the UI
```bash
# Navigate to:
http://localhost:8000
```

### 3. Check Container List
- Look at the **"Restarts"** column
- Should show numbers > 0 for containers that have been restarted

### 4. Trigger a Test Restart (Optional)
- Make a container unhealthy
- Wait for auto-heal to restart it
- Refresh UI - count should increment
- Check JSON file - should have new timestamp

---

## 📊 Expected Results

### Before Fix
```
Container: nginx-proxy
Restarts: 0  ❌ (Wrong - was restarted 5 times)
```

### After Fix
```
Container: nginx-proxy  
Restarts: 5  ✅ (Correct - shows real count from local storage)
```

---

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Issue: Still showing 0

**Try this:**
1. Verify service was restarted: `docker-compose ps`
2. Check if data exists: `type data\restart_counts.json`
3. Check logs: `docker-compose logs autoheal`
4. Hard refresh browser: `Ctrl + Shift + R`

### Issue: Count not incrementing

**Try this:**
1. Verify restart was recorded: `type data\restart_counts.json`
2. Check logs for "record_restart": `docker-compose logs | findstr restart`
3. Verify container was restarted by auto-heal (not manually)

### Issue: Need to reset counts

**Do this:**
```bash
# Backup first
copy data\restart_counts.json data\restart_counts.backup.json

# Reset all counts
echo {} > data\restart_counts.json

# Restart service
docker-compose restart
```

## 📚 Documentation Created

All documentation is ready:

1. **RESTART_COUNT_SOLUTION_COMPLETE.md** - Implementation summary
2. **LOCAL_RESTART_TRACKING_QUICKREF.md** - Quick reference
3. **RESTART_COUNT_VISUAL_SUMMARY.md** - Visual guide
4. **docs/LOCAL_RESTART_TRACKING.md** - Complete documentation

---

## 🎯 Summary

**What changed:**
- Restart counts now come from `data/restart_counts.json` (not Docker)

**Why it's better:**
- ✅ Never resets (persists forever)
- ✅ Accurate (tracks all auto-heal restarts)
- ✅ Reliable (independent of Docker)

**What you need to do:**
1. Restart docker-autoheal service
2. Check UI - counts should now be correct
3. Done! 🎉

## ⚡ Quick Command Reference

```bash
# Restart service
docker-compose restart

# Check data
type data\restart_counts.json

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f autoheal

# Open UI
start http://localhost:8000

# Reset counts (if needed)
echo {} > data\restart_counts.json && docker-compose restart
```

**Ready to go!** Just restart the service and the fix is live! 🚀
